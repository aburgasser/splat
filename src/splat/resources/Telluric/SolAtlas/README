Welcome,

This subdirectory contains a solar spectral atlas obtained with
the  Fourier Transform Spectrometer at the McMath/Pierce Solar Telescope
situated on Kitt Peak, Arizona, and operated by the National Solar
Observatory, a Division of the National Optical Astronomy Observatories.
NOAO is adminsitered by the Association of Univiersities for Research in
Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science
Foundation.

This version of ``An Atlas of the Solar Spectrum in the Infrared from 
1850 to 9000 cm-1 (1.1 to 5.4 microns)'' (N.S.O. Technical Report #91-001,
July 1991) by W. Livingston and L. Wallace is meant to be used in conjunction 
with the original hard-copy version, and the caveats in the text of that 
version apply here equally.

The three spectra in each page of the original are combined into one ascii file
covering the main 25 cm-1 of the page plus 2 cm-1 of overlap on each end.  
Each file is given the name ``wnxxxx'' where xxxx is the wavenumber of the 
beginning of the main 25 cm-1 of the page.  Thus, wn4525 contains the material
from 4525 to 4550 cm-1 plus 2 cm-1 of overlap on each end.  The first column
contains the wavenumber while the second, third and fourth contain the solar
component, the atmospheric component and the total, respectively.  The point
density of the original FTS spectra has been maintained with the result
that each file contains 3061 points.

The parameter ``dg'', which controlled the extent of the gaps in the
original version of the solar component due to strong atmospheric absorption, 
replaces the last point in the ``total''.  The user is warned that in this
version there are no gaps.  Instead, the regions where the solar component is 
undetermined are replaced by linear interpolations between the last ``good'' 
points on each side of the undetermined region.  In order to identify these 
interpolated regions the user must either refer to the plots in the 
original version or use the parameter ``dg'' in the same way as the authors. 

Finally, the intensities of the spectra in each file have been adjusted
to predetermined values.  One result is that the intensities are not
continuous from file to file.  If continuity is required from one file 
to another, the intensities can be readjusted using the spectra in the
overlap region.
